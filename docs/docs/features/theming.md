# Theming

scryme ships with several themes and a custom accent color. Open the **palette** button
(bottom-right of any page) to change them.

- **Preset themes** — Midnight (default dark), Slate, Daylight (light), and Parchment (a warm,
  MTG-flavored light theme).
- **Custom accent** — pick any accent color, or choose one of the quick swatches; reset returns to
  the theme's default.

Your choice is stored in the browser (localStorage) and applied before the page paints, so there's
no flash of the default theme on load. Because it's client-side, theming also works on the
read-only public demo — each visitor gets their own preference.

## Display currency

The same palette menu has a **Currency** toggle — **USD** or **EUR**. scryme shows the matching
Scryfall price (`usd` / `eur`) for *current values*: the [stats](stats.md) collection value and
growth, [deck](decks.md) value and cost-to-complete, the [wishlist](wishlist.md) estimate, and the
card page's price list (the chosen currency leads). It's a price-key choice, **not** a converted
rate.

The default can be set per-deployment with `SCRYME_DEFAULT_CURRENCY=eur`; each visitor's override is
remembered in a cookie. **[Price history](prices.md)** (snapshots, profit/loss, and movers) stays in
USD — it's built on stored USD snapshots and recorded purchase prices, which can't be converted
without an exchange rate.
