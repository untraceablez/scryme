# Price history

The **Prices** page (header link or `/prices`) tracks your collection's value over time, shows
which cards moved the most, and reports your acquisition profit/loss.

- **Acquisition P/L** — for cards with a recorded purchase price, compares what you paid to the
  current market value: total **cost basis**, current **market value**, and the **unrealized
  profit/loss** (dollars and percentage), plus your biggest winners and losers.
- **Collection value over time** — a bar per snapshot, with the current value highlighted.
- **Biggest movers** — the top gainers and losers between the two most recent snapshots, each with
  the old → new price, the dollar change, and the percentage, linking to the card page.

## Acquisition profit/loss

When you import a collection that includes a purchase price (ManaBox's *Purchase price*, Dragon
Shield's *Price Bought*, or Delver Lens's price column), scryme stores it per card. The Prices page
then compares that cost against the current Scryfall market price:

- **Foil-aware** — foil/etched stacks are compared against the foil market price.
- Only cards that have **both** a recorded purchase price **and** a current market price count
  toward the totals; everything else is reported as excluded so the numbers stay honest.
- **Winners/losers** are ranked by total dollar change across the whole stack (quantity × per-card
  change), so a small per-card gain on a big stack can outrank a large gain on a single card.

If none of your cards carry a purchase price, the P/L section is hidden.

## How snapshots are captured

scryme records a price snapshot automatically **after each scheduled Scryfall refresh** (when
prices are freshly updated). The total is foil-aware — foil stacks are valued at the foil price.

You can also capture one manually:

```bash
python -m src.cli snapshot-prices
```

Two snapshots are needed before movers appear, so the page fills in over time. On the read-only
public demo the scheduled refresh is disabled, so snapshots don't accumulate there.
